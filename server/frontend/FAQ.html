            <summary>How to play?</summary>
            <div class=answer>
                The word hunt game is played by building words of three or more
                characters.<br>
                1) First click a letter.<br>
                2) Drag your mouse over to the next letter in the word you want to
                form. It can be formed vertically, horizontally or diagonally,<br>
                but each successive letter must be a bordering letter.<br>
                3) When you build a word of 3+ length that is valid the word will
                turn green. To end the word, click again on the final letter.<br>
                4) If you attempt to trace the same word again it will appear gray
                in the board.<br>
                5) Attempt to build as many words as you can.

            <summary>Is there only one board?</summary>
            <div class=answer>
                Everyday an English and German board is generated. For that date
                those two boards are the only available boards and will be changed
                the next day. So play today, before they're gone!

            <summary>How does the Leaderboard work?</summary>
            <div class=answer>
                Each board has its own leaderboard. There are two dropdown menus:
                date and language. To view the leaderboard select the date and
                language of your desired board. <br>
                For example if I wanted to see the English board's leaderboard for
                12/13 I would select 12/13 and English.

            <summary>What happens if I play the same board twice?</summary>
            <div class=answer>
                You may play the same board as many times as you want! However,
                only your top score will be saved to the leaderboard, along with
                your other stats.
